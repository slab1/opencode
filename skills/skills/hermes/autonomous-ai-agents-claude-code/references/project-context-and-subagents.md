**Project context and custom subagents, moved verbatim from the original skill.** Load when setting up `CLAUDE.md`, the rules directory, or `.claude/agents/` definitions.

## CLAUDE.md — Project Context File

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the project root. Use it to persist project context:

```markdown
# Project: My API

## Architecture
- FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- PostgreSQL database, Redis cache
- pytest for testing with 90% coverage target

## Key Commands
- `make test` — run full test suite
- `make lint` — ruff + mypy
- `make dev` — start dev server on :8000

## Code Standards
- Type hints on all public functions
- Docstrings in Google style
- 2-space indentation for YAML, 4-space for Python
- No wildcard imports
```

**Be specific.** Instead of "Write good code", use "Use 2-space indentation for JS" or "Name test files with `.test.ts` suffix." Specific instructions save correction cycles.

### Rules Directory (Modular CLAUDE.md)
For projects with many rules, use the rules directory instead of one massive CLAUDE.md:
- **Project rules:** `.claude/rules/*.md` — team-shared, git-tracked
- **User rules:** `~/.claude/rules/*.md` — personal, global

Each `.md` file in the rules directory is loaded as additional context. This is cleaner than cramming everything into a single CLAUDE.md.

### Auto-Memory
Claude automatically stores learned project context in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`.
- **Limit:** 25KB or 200 lines per project
- This is separate from CLAUDE.md — it's Claude's own notes about the project, accumulated across sessions

## Custom Subagents

Define specialized agents in `.claude/agents/` (project), `~/.claude/agents/` (personal), or via `--agents` CLI flag (session):

### Agent Location Priority
1. `.claude/agents/` — project-level, team-shared
2. `--agents` CLI flag — session-specific, dynamic
3. `~/.claude/agents/` — user-level, personal

### Creating an Agent
```markdown
# .claude/agents/security-reviewer.md
---
name: security-reviewer
description: Security-focused code review
model: opus
tools: [Read, Bash]
---
You are a senior security engineer. Review code for:
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Secrets in code
- Unsafe deserialization
```

Invoke via: `@security-reviewer review the auth module`

### Dynamic Agents via CLI
```
terminal(command="claude --agents '{\"reviewer\": {\"description\": \"Reviews code\", \"prompt\": \"You are a code reviewer focused on performance\"}}' -p 'Use @reviewer to check auth.py'", timeout=120)
```

Claude can orchestrate multiple agents: "Use @db-expert to optimize queries, then @security to audit the changes."
