## Interactive Session: Slash Commands

### Session & Context
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show all commands (including custom and MCP commands) |
| `/compact [focus]` | Compress context to save tokens; CLAUDE.md survives compaction. E.g., `/compact focus on auth logic` |
| `/clear` | Wipe conversation history for a fresh start |
| `/context` | Visualize context usage as a colored grid with optimization tips |
| `/cost` | View token usage with per-model and cache-hit breakdowns |
| `/resume` | Switch to or resume a different session |
| `/rewind` | Revert to a previous checkpoint in conversation or code |
| `/btw <question>` | Ask a side question without adding to context cost |
| `/status` | Show version, connectivity, and session info |
| `/todos` | List tracked action items from the conversation |
| `/exit` or `Ctrl+D` | End session |

### Development & Review
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/review` | Request code review of current changes |
| `/security-review` | Perform security analysis of current changes |
| `/plan [description]` | Enter Plan mode with auto-start for task planning |
| `/loop [interval]` | Schedule recurring tasks within the session |
| `/batch` | Auto-create worktrees for large parallel changes (5-30 worktrees) |

### Configuration & Tools
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/model [model]` | Switch models mid-session (use arrow keys to adjust effort) |
| `/effort [level]` | Set reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`, or `auto` |
| `/init` | Create a CLAUDE.md file for project memory |
| `/memory` | Open CLAUDE.md for editing |
| `/config` | Open interactive settings configuration |
| `/permissions` | View/update tool permissions |
| `/agents` | Manage specialized subagents |
| `/mcp` | Interactive UI to manage MCP servers |
| `/add-dir` | Add additional working directories (useful for monorepos) |
| `/usage` | Show plan limits and rate limit status |
| `/voice` | Enable push-to-talk voice mode (20 languages; hold Space to record, release to send) |
| `/release-notes` | Interactive picker for version release notes |

### Custom Slash Commands
Create `.claude/commands/<name>.md` (project-shared) or `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` (personal):

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deploy.md
Run the deploy pipeline:
1. Run all tests
2. Build the Docker image
3. Push to registry
4. Update the $ARGUMENTS environment (default: staging)
```

Usage: `/deploy production` — `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with the user's input.

### Skills (Natural Language Invocation)
Unlike slash commands (manually invoked), skills in `.claude/skills/` are markdown guides that Claude invokes automatically via natural language when the task matches:

```markdown
# .claude/skills/database-migration.md
When asked to create or modify database migrations:
1. Use Alembic for migration generation
2. Always create a rollback function
3. Test migrations against a local database copy
```

## Interactive Session: Keyboard Shortcuts

### General Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current input or generation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit session |
| `Ctrl+R` | Reverse search command history |
| `Ctrl+B` | Background a running task |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste image into conversation |
| `Ctrl+O` | Transcript mode — see Claude's thinking process |
| `Ctrl+G` or `Ctrl+X Ctrl+E` | Open prompt in external editor |
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind conversation or code state / summarize |

### Mode Toggles
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle permission modes (Normal → Auto-Accept → Plan) |
| `Alt+P` | Switch model |
| `Alt+T` | Toggle thinking mode |
| `Alt+O` | Toggle Fast Mode |

### Multiline Input
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `\` + `Enter` | Quick newline |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline (alternative) |
| `Ctrl+J` | Newline (alternative) |

### Input Prefixes
| Prefix | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `!` | Execute bash directly, bypassing AI (e.g., `!npm test`). Use `!` alone to toggle shell mode. |
| `@` | Reference files/directories with autocomplete (e.g., `@./src/api/`) |
| `#` | Quick add to CLAUDE.md memory (e.g., `# Use 2-space indentation`) |
| `/` | Slash commands |

### Pro Tip: "ultrathink"
Use the keyword "ultrathink" in your prompt for maximum reasoning effort on a specific turn. This triggers the deepest thinking mode regardless of the current `/effort` setting.

## Monitoring Interactive Sessions

### Reading the TUI Status
```
# Periodic capture to check if Claude is still working or waiting for input
terminal(command="tmux capture-pane -t dev -p -S -10")
```

Look for these indicators:
- `❯` at bottom = waiting for your input (Claude is done or asking a question)
- `●` lines = Claude is actively using tools (reading, writing, running commands)
- `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on` = status bar showing permissions mode
- `◐ medium · /effort` = current effort level in status bar
- `ctrl+o to expand` = tool output was truncated (can be expanded interactively)

### Context Window Health
Use `/context` in interactive mode to see a colored grid of context usage. Key thresholds:
- **< 70%** — Normal operation, full precision
- **70-85%** — Precision starts dropping, consider `/compact`
- **> 85%** — Hallucination risk spikes significantly, use `/compact` or `/clear`
